My Personal OS Project
Introduction
This project represents the culmination of my passion for Operating Systems (OS) and the desire to truly understand how an OS works from the ground up. The main motivation behind creating my own OS was the realization that there are very few small and accessible OS options available to learn and experiment with. While exploring and understanding how an OS operates has always fascinated me, I also wanted to make it easier for others to dive into the world of OS development. My goal is for this project to be a resource that can help anyone interested in understanding OS principles.

Motivation
I initially started this OS project simply out of love for OS development and a desire to understand its inner workings. However, as I continued, I felt a sense of purpose and mission — this project had to be completed! Despite having limited time (I could only work on it during weekends, nights, and holidays), I was determined to make this OS a reality. The journey has been long, and the project took a total of 1 year and 5 months to complete. Every spare moment was dedicated to it, and I went "all-in" on this endeavor, pushing through late nights (the latest being 4 AM) and weekends.

The project has been a combination of passion, perseverance, and dedication, which has proven to be the key to success. Through this journey, I have learned the importance of focus, commitment, and patience when pursuing any goal.

Development Process
Time Commitment
Due to my limited time, I could only work on the OS during weekends, holidays, and after work. This led to a development period of 1 year and 5 months. Despite the long duration, I have been fully committed, putting in as much time as possible during my free hours.

Key Principles: Passion, Interest, and Perseverance
The driving forces behind this project were my passion for OS development and my unwavering interest in how operating systems function. Perseverance played a huge role — even when the project seemed difficult and time-consuming, I kept pushing forward with the understanding that the key to completing any long-term project is resilience.

Features
Lightweight Design: My OS is designed to be small, lightweight, and easy to understand. It's intended as a learning tool for others interested in operating systems.
Extensive Comments: The code is thoroughly commented to help others follow along with the development process and learn from it.
Modularity: The OS is structured in a modular way so that new components and features can easily be added in the future.
To set up and run your OS project, follow these steps:
Compilation:

To compile the operating system, you need to have a cross-compiler and a proper build environment in place. Once ready, you can compile the OS using the following command:

bash
./build_script/build.sh make

This command will compile the necessary source files and generate the bootable image for the OS.
Running the OS:

You can run the OS either on a virtual machine or in a simulator like QEMU. To boot the OS in QEMU, run the following command:

bash
./build_script/run_os.sh run

This will load the compiled kernel image and start the OS.

From here, you can set breakpoints, inspect memory, and step through the code line by line to troubleshoot and understand the behavior of the OS.

Future Goals
Though the OS is functional, I have plans to continue improving it and adding more advanced features, such as:

Process management (multitasking)
Support multi-core 
Multi priority scheduling and fair scheduling
Better memory management 
Device driver support
More file system support
Networking support

Conclusion
This personal OS project has been an incredible journey of learning, dedication, and passion. Although it took over a year to complete, the experience has been invaluable. My hope is that others can use this project to better understand operating system concepts and gain hands-on experience in OS development. This project demonstrates that with the right motivation, commitment, and passion, it's possible to achieve great things even with limited time and resources.
